A true edile hero.  When you think of BBQ ribs you think of a slow smoker, or a backyard grill.  You imagine the scent and odor of the carmelizing barbecue sauce filling  your nostrils.  Can you taste it yet?  Well forget about it.  Unless you want to go to a fancy restaurant and fork over the dough you are out of luck.  It's winter, it's too cold to go outside and do it.  You start sulking away... WAIT!  Don't fear!  If you have a crockpot, you can make fall-off-the-bone ribs that people will swear took much more time and effort.  Let me show you how
</p>

	The thing I love most about my crockpot is that I don't have to hover around the kitchen.  Now, I do enjoy snacking on things I find around the kitchen, so you may find me hovering anyway, but I don't like hovering while cooking.  Most things I cook in the crockpot only take 20-30 min of preparation and then just a nice slow 7-8 hours of cooking.  It's literally fool proof.  The first thing you need to start with are some delicious ribs.  I bought mine at Winco, a place I love nearly as much as ribs.<img class="img-responsive headline headline-sm pull-right" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CzL7vEZMN7Q/UwAvR5ZoKqI/AAAAAAAABgc/p6iu88974tc/w662-h883-no/IMG_0283.JPG">  I got two full rakcs of St Louis style pork ribs for just under $20.  Two full racks people.  What do you pay for a full rack at Texas Roadhouse?  You will also need some BBQ sauce.  Lots of it.  I used about 32oz.  You can get any brand/flavor/mix that you want.  I actually used two 16oz bottles of two different flavors.  Here's what you do

<h3>Ingredient List</h3>
<ul>
	<li>1 or 2 racks of ribs (something no taller than your crockpot)</li>
	<li>At least 32oz of BBQ sauce</li>
	<li><em>Optional</em> A clove of garlic</li>
	<li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps to deliciousness</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Lay your ribs on a clean surface and season liberally for salt and pepper</li>
	<li>Mince about 3/4 of your garlic clove if you so desire garlic.  My brother and his fiance loved the garlic tang but I almost felt it over powered it.  I was the only one who felt this way though, everyone else dug the garlic</li>
	<li>Lay the ribs (meaty side out) in the crockpot along the sides</li>
	<li>Pour all your BBQ sauce into the pot and all over the ribs except for a few ounces that you will want later</li>
	<li>Set the crockpot to low and forget about it and enjoy the manly meaty order that will begin permeating throughout your home</li>
	<li>7-8 hours later, carefully (with some help) get the ribs out and onto a large cookie sheet.  The ribs may start breaking and thats ok, but just get them out of there!</li>
	<li>Add the extra BBQ sauce you saved and spread it on top of the ribs</li>
	<li>Broil the ribs in the oven for 5-6 min until the BBQ sauce is carmelized</li>
	<li>Serve and enjoy</li>
</ol>
<p>
	That's it.  It's very simple and very delicious.  Please do enjoy!
