Over time she evolved to do more and more of the menial things we don't like to do but she still jots a mean note for you... or does she?  I recently tried using dictation on my MacBook Air in a work meeting, just to see what it would pick up.  The results were hilarious.

	Now before you start thinking I'm an Apple hater, think again.  I love all things Apple.  I'm close to a fan boy.  That doesn't mean I don't also play with Android and have Linux on my work machine.  I do.  When it comes to my personal preference, however, I usually side with Apple.  Anyway, now that that's out of the way, I had some real gems in my dictation session.  I think to be fair though I need to say that most of the conversation that my computer tried to dictate was quiet and probably hard to hear.  It did manage to do surprisingly well when I was the one speaking (since the computer was right in front of me), but otherwise it was awful.  The conversation mostly centered around roles of developers vs. product owners, and as you will see, some of these statements were just hilarious.

	<li>...Ask for help wife because I do you say let's cuddle right this bro bro bro...</li>
	<li>...10 hour so hot cocoa...</li>
	<li>...it got this result every time, that's what it wanted to kiss you...</li>
</ul>

	The list goes on.  Moral of the story is dictation can not yet be trusted to take active notes for your meeting.  It doesn't mean it can't be hilarious though.  I realize this may have been funnier given what knowledge of what was <em>actually said</em> in the meeting compared to what dictation thought was said.  But this is my blog right?  I'll say what I want!
