In fact, this entire site is built with angular.js.  I built a bunch of custom directives, services and controllers to help you get the look and feel you see here.  While building this site it became clear that I needed to build a few custom components.  I realized quickly that I would want to show code snippets in my blog posts when I talk code.  There are tools like google-code-prettify which I took advantage of in my module.  I wanted to make a directive where I could just enter my code snippets in plain, pre-formatted text and have it render in a sexy way while also linking to a plunkr example that you can try and view.

    Building custom components is not hard.  If you've never made any custom directives, you should check out <blink interval="1000"><a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/HveN3KzXFiBiuExLay77?p=preview" target="_blank">this plunker</a></blink> and you will see how easy it is to bring the blink tag back to life.

    <em>Disclaimer</em>: I don't reccommend recreating all of HTMLs most hated/revered old tags.  The <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> is where it belongs right now
</p>
<p>
	  The code sample box is a bit more involved.  It does a pretty good job of handling most things, but there are still a few situations where it fails so this really is only reliable for a case by case scenario right now.  For my code sample box, here's what I came up with
</p>
<ed-code plunk="http://plnkr.co/edit/rC04TYAkfWuPqSu0gWeI">
 angular.module('ed.web').directive('edCode',[function(){
  var dir = {};
  dir.scope = {
    plunk: '@'
  };
  dir.restrict = 'E';
  dir.transclude = true;
  dir.link = function(scope, elem, attr, ctrl, transclude) {
    var code = angular.element('&lt;div&gt;').append(transclude());
    code = code.html().indexOf('&lt;span class="ng-scope"&gt;') != -1 ? code.find('span').html() : code.html();
    elem.find('pre').append(prettyPrintOne(code.replace(/ 'ng-scope'/g,"")
      .replace(/ 'class="ng-scope"'/g,"")
      .replace(/\t/g,"")
      .replace(/</g,'&lt;')
      .replace(/>/g,'&gt;')));
  };
  return dir;
}])
</ed-code>

	After making this I realized that it was sort of difficult to actually run my code formatter through my code formatter.  I know, messes with your brain.  Long story short I tried to get it to remove some of the <code>&lt;span class="ng-scope"&gt;</code> tags that angular adds among a few other things.  If you follow the plunker you will see a working example with the css formatter file.
