In fact, this entire site is built with angular.js.  I built a bunch of custom directives, services and controllers to help you get the look and feel you see here.  Now I'm not a designer, but with <a href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">angular.js</a>, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap 3</a> and <a href="http://lesscss.org" target="_blank">LESS</a> for my CSS, I feel like a designer.  I'm going to show you how you can make awesome custom components with angular.js that are reusable, testable and awesome!
