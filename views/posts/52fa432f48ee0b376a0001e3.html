	I love meat.  I don't know how many of you share that sentiment, but meat is amazing.  There are so many delightful ways to prepare it that it never gets boring, and I have yet to find a substitute that is as mouthwateringly juicy and succulent to replace it.  I'm not going to claim that I invented this <a href="http://jessicaburns.com/2011/10/braised-pork-shoulder-with-roasted-root-vegetables/" target="_blank">recipie</a>, but I did improve on it by using my trusty crockpot.
